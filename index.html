     <p>Here's some things about me!<br>
     I like to play games, such as:<br>
     Minecraft, Roblox and Team Fortress 2! (<i>rarely..</i>)<br>
     I'm a big tech nerd, and I'm learning webdev, obviously! Oh.. I'm also a furry, I don't like to shove it in people's face though.
     Anyways, here's a <b>HUUGE</b> picture of a cat!</p>
